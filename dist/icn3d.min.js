For AlphaFold structures, the "Chain ID" is "A".<br/>If you load a custom structure without PDB or UniProt ID, you can open "Seq. & Annotations" window and find the chain ID such as "stru_A". The part before the underscore is the structure ID, which can be used to specify the mutation such as "stru_A_...".
