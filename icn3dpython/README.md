Python Scripts based on iCn3D
=============================

Either Python scripts in the directory "icn3dpython" or Node.js scripts in the directory "icn3dnode" can be used to analyze structures in command line <b>with one second sleep time in between</b>.

You can write Python scripts either based on iCn3D URLs as shown in the directory "icn3d_url", or by following the interactive steps in the directory "web_scraping", which enables you to extract any output from the UI.
