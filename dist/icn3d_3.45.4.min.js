Residue selection could be residue number(5-10), one-letter IUPAC residue name abbreviations(LV), three-letter residue names(AlaVal, "3" indicates each residue name has three letters), or predefined names: "proteins", "nucleotides", "chemicals", "ions", and "water". IUPAC abbreviations can be written either as a contiguous string(e.g., ":LV"), in order to find all instances of that sequence in the structure, or they can be separated by commas(e.g., ":L,V") to select all residues of a given type in the structure(in the latter case, select all Leucine and Valine in the structure).<br/>',n+='<li>"@CA,C,C*" uses "@" to indicate atom name selection.
